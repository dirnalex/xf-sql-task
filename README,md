To test the scripts you need to have MySQL database installed.

To feed the database with data - run the /scripts/init.sql script.
It will recreate the xf schema and fill it with the tables and data needed.
!!!Important: the old xf schema will be removed - keep it in mind.

To run the first query from the task - execute the /scripts/query1.sql script.

To run the second query from the task - execute the /scripts/query2.sql script.
